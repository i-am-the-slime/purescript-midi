purescript-midi examples
========================

### v1.1.0 examples

* __keyboard-signal__ demonstrates logging web-midi messages.

### v1.0.0 examples

These are now a little out of date because they use async effects (Aff) for web-midi rather than signals. Soundfonts are taken from polyphonic-soundfonts 1.0.0.

* __midifile__ demonstrates basic MIDI file parsing.
* __abcfile__ demonstrates converting an ABC file to a MIDI recording.
* __keyboard__ demonstrates a playable keyboard that uses a variety of instrument soundfonts.

and three different players: 

* __simpleplayer__ demonstrates playing a MIDI file by converting to a single uninterruptible Web-Audio graph.
* __player__ demonstrates a MIDI player widget that plays each note as an individual Web-Audio instruction.
* __hybridplayer__ demonstrates a MIDI player widget that plays a phrase (consisting of a bunch of notes) before allowing a UI update.
